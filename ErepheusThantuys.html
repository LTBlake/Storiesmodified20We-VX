                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-4"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>A long time ago, before the time of Zeus, a dark land of evil emerged in the black waters of Crete. It had thousands of evil creatures living on it including cyclops, Nemesis’s horse and other creatures. It stayed there, with its power growing and undisturbed by the gods and titans. When Hermes found out when sending a message from Zeus to Poseidon, he abandoned the messaging mission and flew back to Zeus as fast as he can. When he reached there, he told Zeus about the land. That made Zeus angry about two things. One is the message not sent to Poseidon about building Atlantis and the appearance of the dark land. Without doubt, Zeus sent out the strongest people he can ever find and ordered them to destroy the land. The leader of the army was Zeus himself. Unfortunately, the land was too strong. Zeus called Poseidon to build Atlantis as fast as Poseidon could. So, Poseidon did. The battle went on for a long time and many heroes died many heroes also joined. Finally, when Atlantis was finished it was used as a base to fight the dark land. Soon the land was overwhelmed by the army of Zeus. But the soil of the land regenerates evil and Zeus has no way of destroying evil completely for the land is indestructible, for now. So, he ordered Hades to build the strongest explosive thunder he could ever make. So, he mixed 75 parts soul pepper, 15 parts heavy lightning and 10 parts soul gas. With these, he made the strongest explosive ever found. Zeus than put the explosive on the dark land. The land exploded and souls harvested and ate all the evil, except for one; it was buried in the core of the dark land where all the ichor was, which makes the crystal immortal. The crystal fell to earth, but inactivated, the crystal doesn’t emerge evil at this point. After that, Zeus named the land Αντίπαλος της Ατλαντίδος, which means the enemy of Atlantis.
<div>
</div><div>Then, with the cheer of peace, the gods celebrated in Atlantis and Mount Olympus, where Athena, the Goddess of wisdom was born. Athena then found the crystal and put it upon the box of Pandora. Evil emerged over the world and that made the gods very anxious. It even got worse. Thantuys, one of the strongest evil titans that appeared through the Pandora box became the leader of the evil. When all hope seems to be gone, Zeus had a child with a mortal girl. The child was called Erepheus. Erepheus trained everyday and tried to achieve a goal: to see what his true goal was without being told. He fought and fought; from wolves and beasts to Thantuys’ guards. Finally, he saw his fate: death through a glorious war, or alive but achieves nothing. He seeks for glory and fights even stronger for it. After time he was even stronger than Zeus himself. He then went to challenge Thantuys. Not surprised, Erepheus slayed Thantuys without any trouble. But that set a curse upon him: the curse of undead. That took the soul out of him and he lived as a soul-less body, which made Zeus and the Olympian gods weep. In addition, the death of Thantuys angered Nemesis and prevented the soul of Thantuys dying. Then, Thantuys’ soul moved into who we all should know.
</div><div>
</div><div>Appendix: The soul of Thantuys moved into many different people in other regions but disappeared in Greek mythology. One of the best examples was Satan Of Bible. Of course, We don’t know who Thantuys is now, but he may be in you whenever you are angry.
