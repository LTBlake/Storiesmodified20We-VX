</div><div>"Come on," Moaned Joana as she tugged at her mother, "We have to go now!"
</div><div>"To where?" Her mother asked in an innocent tone. They are walking down the Sunbeat Streets after they went to the store to buy snacks for their night. They held their hands, walking in the middle of the streets, where the cars rushed by.
</div><div>"Mother, shouldn't we be walking at the sidewalk?" Asked Joana. 
</div><div>"No," She said, "There are bad men there. It's the night, darling." Joana could do nothing but walk on.
</div><div>
</div><div>The buildings beside them seemed the same, like lego blocks on the board. The cold seemed to penetrate their skins into their bones. 
</div><div>"Where are we going?" Joana's mother asked.
</div><div>"To Mrs.Maloney's class," Joana replied.
</div><div>
</div><div>Joana has never seen his father before. Her mother says it was long before she was born. Her father went to exploration in the far north and has never returned. Her mother, on the other hand, is behaving strangely. First, it seems to Joana that it was Joana who was caring for her mother more than her mother caring for her. Joana has been caring for her so much that she might not survive without her. 
</div><div>
</div><div>One of the things she is most afraid of is having her mother took away by charities because they found them odd. She wanted to stay with her mother forever, so she had to protect her from any possible dangers. 
</div><div>
</div><div>Whenever they went out to shop, her mother always reported that there are enemies who pose a danger to him. Joana thought that was real and followed her mother. Soon, Joana realized that the 'enemies' are just in her imagination, and she only has to play the assistant, or she will be upset.
</div><div>
</div><div>When they arrived at Mrs. Maloney's door, they rang the cold, freezing doorbell that is of shiny gold in the crisp autumn air. 
</div><div>The door pulled itself open in a reluctant way with Mrs. Maloney's head popping out.
</div><div>"Can I help you?" She asked, "Oh, it's Joana! Come in!"
</div><div>
</div><div>Joana led her mother in politely and sat down where Mrs. Maloney directed them. They sat close to each other as Joana loved her mother so much.
</div><div>"So, what is it you want?" Asked Mrs. Maloney.
</div><div>Joana hesitated before speaking. She had so many thoughts, and they stirred her mind like an egg. It took her about a dozen seconds before speaking, 
</div><div>"Would you mind if I let my mother stay at your house temporarily? It wouldn't be long before I return, I promise." Joana's mother looked at her in worries. Joana looked back at her and smiled briskly. Mrs. Maloney felt proud of the child. 
</div><div>"It's okay. Definitely. I don't mean to reject it, but why would you want your mother to be here?" Mrs. Maloney asked politely.
</div><div>"I'm sorry, but I don't want to explain this."
</div><div>"Is she Ill?"
</div><div>"I said I don't want to explain this!" Joana said, with a short whimper. "I will call you every morning. Mrs. Maloney, I have your number. I'll see you soon." She sobbed at the last sentence and started to out the door, which was still wide open. Her mother just stayed, believing her daughter to be right. Mrs. Maloney had never seen a child so persistent before. She wanted to stop Joana, but she paused because she knew that this is not her business.
