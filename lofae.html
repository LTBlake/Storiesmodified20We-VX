                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">The fire was reaching Ralph. Sweat danced out his skin. 
<div>“Don’t scream. Don’t scream!” thought Ralph. The people are closing in. He hid under that bush. Soon he saw a pair of legs. Then he saw a broad chest…then, a face! Ralph screamed like an un-tuned violin playing with dry and barren and yet tough bow. He picked up his dual weapon Rom &amp; Rem and stood up, firing madly at the savages. They fell to the ground, and yet Jack, carrying a Thantuys shield and a light-tactical weapon Erepheus. Seeing the chief carrying a large protective shield and a deadly and “one-shot-kill” weapon was frightening, thus Ralph backed up, dodging ammos Jack was throwing. Ralph ejaculated as he smashed both his weapons down on the floor and laid his fingers on his sword,” Jack! The island has fallen! It is you who led us to our doom and only you can fix it!” Jack was immediately angered. The fire was closing in like the storm in Fortnite.
</div><div>Jack threw his shield and gun away and drew his sword and pointed it at Ralph and shouted desperately: “Only if you can make me, the chief of this island!!!” Ralph drew his sword and the two and only boys collided into a deadly and only one can survive duel. There were sounds of swords clashing but it seemed like a mouse squeaking in the fires. Jack was a skilled warrior as Ralph was brave and tactical. The fire was closing in, as both locked their sword, with their sweating and dirty with blood face staring dead into each other.
</div><div>Ralph said threateningly,” If we kill another, the other will still be devoured by the fiery infernal beast, thus we can see no more springs and sunny days!”
</div><div>Jack hissed menacingly,” I only want glory to the selfishness of my own!” Then, the two boys started the deadly match again. The sword missed Ralph by inches, and that alerted Ralph seriously, and he went into a deadly three-shot attack. After the three attacks, a simple line of blood appeared on Jacks shirt, and he seemed hurt. Over the flames, Jack and Ralph knelt, exhausted. 
</div><div>“What have I done?” Whispered Jack. The menacing fire inched closer and closer to the boys. Unexpectedly, the boys hugged each other, and regretted for what they have done. The fire was no more than a meter away now, and over the sizzling sound they heard a steady and deep and yet repeating voice. A helicopter. The pilot saw that in the last part of the island without flames, was two boys. He dropped the ladders, and Ralph lead Jack up them. They were safe, both the seed of leadership and rebellion, with the bible and Satan.
